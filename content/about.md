I’m a full-stack developer with a passion for backend development and open-source projects. Over the years, I’ve worked with a range of technologies, frameworks, and platforms, but I particularly enjoy crafting efficient backend systems and scalable architectures.

## Technical Skills

- **Backend**: PHP, Laravel, Scala, NodeJS, Python
- **Frontend**: React
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (I’m especially fond of Arch Linux)
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, ArgoCD, and more
- **Other Interests**: Game development, system administration, and open-source contributions

## What I Do

While I specialize in backend development, I often find myself working across the full stack. My expertise includes developing microservices, creating scalable web architectures, and maintaining high-performance applications. I love experimenting with new technologies, improving workflows, and solving challenging problems.

My blog focuses primarily on technical topics related to PHP, Laravel, Linux, game development, and sysadmin. I also document personal thoughts and experiences through my journal entries.
