Created my blog again with [zola](https://getzola.org) and migrated old jekyll posts to the zola. I used a python script to translate them to correct format. I need to re-organize tags and categories because I use same taxonomies for tags and categories.

I'm considering using more than one language on my blog, but I'm not entirely sure because it might slow down the writing process. I can't decide whether it should be in English or Turkish. Having some parts in English and others in Turkish makes me a bit uncomfortable. When I use only English, I feel like my productivity will decrease. Still, switching to English seems like the more logical choice.
